For example, when you pass the number 100 as an argument to your function, the result should be 97.

Input: 100 -> Output: 97

a1. (Extra Challenge ğŸ’ª) Modify your function to support numbers greater than 100 as well.

b. Write a function that calculates the sum of the first prime number greater than the given number and the first prime number smaller than the given number.

Input: 100

-> First prime number smaller than 100: 97

-> First prime number greater than 100: 101

Output: 101 + 97
